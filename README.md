# Diabetes Prediction Web Application

This is a web application that uses a deep learning model to predict diabetes based on various health parameters. The application is built using Flask and TensorFlow.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tain03/assignment_03.git
    cd assignment_03
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv diabetes-env
    # On Windows
    diabetes-env\Scripts\activate
    # On MacOS/Linux
    source diabetes-env/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Run the data preprocessing script**:

    ```bash
    python load_data.py
    ```

    This will download the dataset, preprocess it, and save the preprocessed data to a file named `preprocessed_data.npz`.

### Model Training

1. **Run the model training script**:

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

    This will train a deep learning model on the preprocessed data and save the trained model to a file named `diabetes_model.h5`.

### Running the Web Application

1. **Run the Flask web application**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Usage

1. **Open your web browser and navigate to** `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. **Enter the required health parameters** into the form and click the "Predict" button.
3. **View the prediction result** on the same page.
